**Index of Need for Health Facilities that Offer PrEP in Los Angeles County** <br>
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication that if taken as prescribed greatly reduces the chances of an individual from contracting HIV if exposed to it. HIV does not affect everyone equally; there are disproportionate high rates of HIV in racial/ethnic minority communities specifically the African American and Hispanic population. The social determinants of health related to HIV: education level, uninsured rates, households living under the poverty level and spatial distribution of health facilities were used in this study in order to create an index of need in order to asses which communities in Los Angeles County have a need for health facilities that offer PrEP.  Kernel density of health facilities and Euclidean distances were also incorporated. Using geospatial information systems (GIS) the data was reclassified and weighted in order to be ranked from low to high need. The index showed a disproportionate geographical distribution of need in Los Angeles County. 

**Disproportionate Spatial Distribution of Tobacco Retailer License Density Among Racial and Impoverished Groups in Los Angeles County in 2012** <br>

Over the last sixty years, the prevention of cigarette smoking in the United States has become a significant public health activity as it represents the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. The goal of our study is to identify correlations between race and poverty with the spatial distribution of tobacco retail licenses in Los Angeles (LA), California. In order to identify these relationships, our research group compiled data from the United States Census Bureau American Fact Finder and the State of California Tobacco Retailer Licenses for the year 2012. Using these datasets, we mapped the density of LA tobacco retailers, Korean, African-American, and White racial groups, and the percentage of these racial groups living below the federal poverty line. Our results demonstrate that a high density of tobacco retailers are disproportionately found in neighborhoods with a high percentage of racial and ethnic minorities, such as African Americans and Koreans. This is an important distinction as neighborhoods with a low density of tobacco retailers have higher percentages of White residents. Additionally, these neighborhoods with a higher density of tobacco retailers were also found to have higher percentages of racial and ethnic minorities living below the federal poverty line compared to neighborhoods with lower densities of tobacco retailers. These results suggest that increased access to tobacco products could augment socioeconomic disparities and encourage the need for more tailored smoking cessation programs.
